Good morning, good afternoon and good night!

I am Tao Deng, currently a second-year Ph.D. student in Data Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), where mentored by Professor [Tianwei Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianwei/) from the School of Data Science. I am also conducting research projects under the supervision of Professor [Hao Wu](https://www.haowulab.org/) at [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/). Prior to this, I obtained my B.S. degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology from [Zhongnan University of Economics and Law (ZUEL)](http://english.zuel.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China.

My research interests include developing machine learning and statistical methods to address challenges in the analysis of single-cell and spatial omics data.
